                Vintech (Pty) Ltd, Many IT service providers that work with small businesses are called managed service providers.
                This can actually encompass a variety of specifics, but allows the business to service the company’s network on an ongoing basis at a regular rate.
                It is often less costly for companies over time, since it can prevent expensive problems from forming in the first place. T
                his is the type of service that Vintech offers eventually landed on for his business, Vintech (Pty) Ltd .
                The CEO  says, “We decided to make the change from reacting to problems and move toward a standards based configuration where we provide surveillance to see what’s going on and resolve issues before they actually turn into problems.”
                On Demand IT Another way to structure an IT service business is by offering services on demand. You can still offer the same variety of specific functions.
                But instead of companies paying a regular monthly fee, they just pay for each individual service when they need it.
                Network Setup You could also offer a preliminary setup service for businesses just looking to get their networks up and running.
                It’s possible to offer this as a standalone service, but could be even more valuable as part of a managed IT package.
